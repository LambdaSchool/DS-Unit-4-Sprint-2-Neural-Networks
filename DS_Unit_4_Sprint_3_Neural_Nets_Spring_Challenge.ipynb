        "\n",
        "- Neuron: neurons receive inputs and pass on their signal to the next layer of nodes if a certain threshold is reached\n",
        "- Input Layer: The Input Layer is what receives input from our dataset. Sometimes it is called the visible layer because it's the only part that is exposed to our data and that our data interacts with directly.\n",
        "- Hidden Layer: Layers after the input layer are called Hidden Layers. This is because they cannot be accessed except through the input layer. They're inside of the network and they perform their functions, but we don't directly interact with them. \n",
        "- Output Layer: The final layer is called the Output Layer. The purpose of the output layer is to output a vector of values that is in a format that is suitable for the type of problem that we're trying to address\n",
        "- Activation: The activation function decides whether a cell \"fires\" or not. Sometimes it is said that the cell is \"activated\" or not. In Artificial Neural Networks activation functions decide how much signal to pass onto the next layer. \n",
        "- Backpropagation: Back-propagation is the essence of neural net training. It is the practice of fine-tuning the weights of a neural net based on the error rate (i.e. loss) obtained in the previous epoch (i.e. iteration). Proper tuning of the weights ensures lower error rates, making the model reliable by increasing its generalization."
