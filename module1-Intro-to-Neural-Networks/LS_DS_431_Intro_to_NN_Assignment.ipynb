        "### Input Layer:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The Input Layer is the 1st neuron layer which receives input from our dataset. \n",
        "* This is also called the visible layer because it's the only part that is exposed to our data and that our data interacts with directly. \n",
        "* Typically node maps within the input layer corresponds with one input node for each of the different inputs/features/columns of our dataset that will be passed to the neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Hidden Layer:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The neuron layers between Input layer and Output layer are called Hidden layers since it cannot be accessed directly.\n",
        "* Weighted sum of inputs and bias from previous layers are passed onto hidden layer for processing.\n",
        "* There can be multiple hidden layers and usually refers to Deep Learning.\n",

        "### Output Layer:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The final layer of Neural Network is called Output layer.\n",
        "* The purpose of the output layer is to output a vector of values that is in a format that is suitable for the type of problem that we're trying to address.\n",
        "* This is handled using activation functions based on the problem.\n",
        "1. Regression - Single output node for providing continous value.\n",

        "An artificial neuron is a mathematical function are elementary units in an artificial neural network. The artificial neuron receives one or more inputs and sums them to produce an output. Usually each input is separately weighted, and the sum is passed through a non-linear function known as an **activation  or transfer function**. The transfer functions can be sigmoid, rectified linear unit ReLU or step functions...\n",

        "It maps the resulting values into the desired range such as between 0 to 1 or -1 to 1 etc. (depending upon the choice of activation function). For example, the use of the logistic activation function would map all inputs in the real number domain into the range of 0 to 1.\n",

        "\n",
        "The first and simplest kind of neural network that we could talk about is the perceptron. A perceptron is just a single node or neuron of a neural network with nothing else. It can take any number of inputs and gives out an output. \n",
