    "## Define the Following:\n",
    "You can add image, diagrams, whatever you need to ensure that you understand the concepts below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The input layer is what receives input from our dataset. It is sometimes called the visible layer because it's the only part that is exposed to our data and that our data interacts with directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically node maps are drawn with one input node for each of the different inputs/features/columns of our dataset that will be passed to the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hidden Layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hidden layers are the layers after the input layer. They are called hidden because they cannot be accessed except through the input layer. They're inside of the network and they perform their functions, but we don't directly interact with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the final layer. Its purpose is to output a vector of values that is in a format that is suitable for the type of problem that we're trying to address. This specifies what you are actually trying to predict with your neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neuron:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Biology, a Neuron is an electrically excitable cell that communicates with other cells via specialized connections called synapses. Composed of a nucleus, cell body, dendrites (which receive the stimulus) and axons (transmit the stimulus to other neurons). \n",
    "\n",
    "In DS, it is a single node. What a neuron does is it takes each of the input values, multiplies each of them by a weight, sums all of these products up, and then passes the sum through what is called an \"activation function\" the result of which is the final value.\n",
    "\n",
    "What a neuron does is it takes each of the input values, multiplies each of them by a weight, sums all of these products up, and then passes the sum through what is called an \"activation function\" the result of which is the final value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weight:\n",
    "\n",
    "A weight is a connection between neurons that carries a value. The higher the value, the larger the weight, and the more importance we attach to neuron on the input side of the weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are values multiplied to the different inputs in order to determine how important or nonimportant features are to the desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activation Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Neural Networks, each node has an activation function. Each node in a given layer typically has the same activation function. These activation functions are the biggest piece of neural networks that have been inspired by actual biology. \n",
    "\n",
    "The activation function decides whether a cell \"fires\" or not. Sometimes it is said that the cell is \"activated\" or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Artificial Neural Networks activation functions decide how much signal to pass onto the next layer. This is why they are sometimes referred to as transfer functions because they determine how much signal is transferred to the next layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Types:\n",
    "- Sigmoid\n",
    "- tanh\n",
    "- Step\n",
    "- ReLu\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node Map:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Node Map is a visual diagram of the architecture or \"topology\" of our neural network. It's kind of like a flow chart in that it shows the path from inputs to outputs. They are usually color coded and help us understand at a very high level, some of the differences in architecture between kinds of neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perceptron:\n",
    "\n",
    "A perceptron is just a single node or neuron of a neural network with nothing else. It can take any number of inputs and spit out an output. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias is also a weight. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you’re thinking about a situation (trying to make a decision). You have to think about all possible (or observable) factors. But what about parameters you haven’t come across? What about factors you haven’t considered? \n",
    "\n",
    "In a Neural Net, we try to cater for these unforeseen or non-observable factors. This is the bias. Every neuron that is not on the input layer has a bias attached to it, and the bias, just like the weight, carries a value. "

    "\n",
    "### Explain the flow of information through a neural network from inputs to outputs. Be sure to include: inputs, weights, bias, and activation functions. How does it all flow from beginning to end?\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs receieve the data from the dataset. Each neuron, or node, has an input value that goes into the hidden layer where their weights are assigned and the bias is found in order to get these values to the proper outputs which should provide a better solution for the output value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, under the hidden layer, the activation function helps normalize all the data to 0 or 1 depending on its numerical value so that there is no large outliers that skew the data."
