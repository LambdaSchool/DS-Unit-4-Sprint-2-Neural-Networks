        "You can add image, diagrams, whatever you need to ensure that you understand the concepts below.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Input Layer:\n",
        "Input layers are defined as a collection of all the possible input nodes. Can also be referred to as the visible layer. Input nodes have a 1 to 1 relationship with the number of features in a dataset.\n",
        "### Hidden Layer:\n",
        "Hidden layers are a collection of hidden nodes between a NN's input nodes and output nodes. Specifically it's a grouping for one step (think column-wise) in the NN. Hidden nodes take in input like input nodes and output as well, but they are just a step in the NN's map to produce an actual output. As a result, output of hidden nodes isn't meaningful.\n",
        "### Output Layer:\n",
        "The output layer is a collection of all the output nodes. The number of output nodes depends on the type of problem the NN is attempting to solve. For classification problems the number of output nodes will match up with the number of possible classes. Linear regression will have 1. Output nodes are basically the target (a value or class).\n",
        "### Neuron:\n",
        "Neurons are compenents of the human brain. In machine learning terms a neuron is a node. There are many different types of nodes, but the most important are the input, hidden, and output nodes.\n",
        "### Weight:\n",
        "Weights are values that hidden nodes possess. They are close to but not exactly like coefficients. They weight the input by however much and then pass the output to the next layer of nodes. Weighting can be initialized randomly and with gradient descent/backpropigation they can be adjusted accordingly through successive iterations.\n",
        "### Activation Function:\n",
        "Activation functions are the functions that certain nodes possess (mainly hidden?) that pass a value to the next layer of nodes. They are sometimes referred to as transfer functions. For classification networks the more common activation functions are sigmoid, tanh, step, relu.\n",
        "### Node Map:\n",
        "A node map is a diagram of how data flows in and out of the neural network. Node maps can vary ever so slightly from problem to problem but most maps will resemble the common neural network topologies like perceptrons, feed forward, RBF, DFF, etc.\n",
        "### Perceptron:\n",
        "Perceptrons are single layers neural networks. A neural network at its most basic. Perceptrons only have an input and output layer and thus no activation functions."

        "Neural networks take input and produce output. Input nodes are the first layer of nodes in a neural network and are responsible for taking in the features initially. Input nodes then pass the given value to the \"correct\" hidden node. This node weights the input (multiplies by a certain value) and applies a bias (adding or subtracting a certain amount). Once the input is processed with the weight and bias the activation function passes this value to the next layer of nodes in the NN. This is repeated through however many layers of hidden nodes the NN has until it reaches the output layer which can either be a value or classification."
