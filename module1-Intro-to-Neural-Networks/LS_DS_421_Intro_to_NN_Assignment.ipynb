We then feed the inputs into the through the network by dot producting the weights and inputs plus the bias (usually one) and applying an activation function to the result. We do this for each node in the hidden layers. Once we reach the output layer, we measure the result and assessing the cost. We then adjust the weights and do it again until our cost function is close to optimal."
