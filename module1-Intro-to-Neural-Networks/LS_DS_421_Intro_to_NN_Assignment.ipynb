    "You can add image, diagrams, whatever you need to ensure that you understand the concepts below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Layer:\n",
    "* An input layer is the information that you feed in to a system.  Whatever the data is.  This is what the neural network will use to determine outputs.\n",
    "### Hidden Layer:\n",
    "* A hidden layer in a neural network is a layer that is doing some work on the inputs, but cannot be seen or desribed by looking at it.  They are the steps between the input and output of a network.  It uses weights and biases to perform work on the data. The outputs are also determined by a given activation function of the network.\n",
    "### Output Layer:\n",
    "* The output layer are the predictions or classification of the data after it has gone through the network. As stated previously, it is helped to be determined by the activation function used in the neural network.\n",
    "### Neuron:\n",
    "* A Neuron (or node) in a neural network is the what the basic make-up of the network is. Each input, bias, hidden node, and output is a Neuron in the network.  Things get passed on, again, determined by the activation function through each layer, to determine the final Neurons (outputs).\n",
    "### Weight:\n",
    "* A weight is something that is attached to an input of the network.  They are set at the beginnning and adjusted throughout the training period of the network.  Weights essentially determine how influential an input is in determining the ouput.\n",
    "### Activation Function:\n",
    "* Have been talknig a lot about activation functions.  Their main function .. tee hee .. is to deal with non-linear data.  It can shrink information down to lower dimensions to then get a number that the network can use to determine the output.  In a classification case, the network uses the number produced by the activation function to determine what class the input is.\n",
    "### Node Map:\n",
    "![Neural Network Zoo](http://www.asimovinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/neuralnetworks.png)\n",
    "### Perceptron:\n",
    "* A Perceptron is one of the more basic neural networks.  It is typically used to classify binary outputs. It consists of 1 working neuron, that takes information from data (inputs) and tosses it out so that the activation function can determine it's value."
