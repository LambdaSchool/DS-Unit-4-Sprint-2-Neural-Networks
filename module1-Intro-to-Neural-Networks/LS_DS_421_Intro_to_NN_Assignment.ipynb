The inputs are then multiplied by their weights, which determines how much importance the inputs have on the outputs. These are then summed together and passed through an activation function, which determines whether the weighted sum is greater than a certain threshold value--equivalent to the bias value--and as a result, is then assigned either a 1 or 0 as an output"
