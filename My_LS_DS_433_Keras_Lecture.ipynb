It doesn't activate neurons that are being passed a negative signal and passes on positive signals. Think about why this might be useful. Remember how a lot of our initial weights got set to negative numbers by chance? This would have dealt with those negative weights a lot faster than the sigmoid function updating. What does the derivative of this function look like? It looks like the step function! This means that not all neurons are activated. With sigmoid basically all of our neurons are passing some amount of signal even if it's small making it hard for the network to differentiate important and less important connections. ReLU turns off a portion of our less important neurons which decreases computational load, but also helps the network learn what the most important connections are faster. \n",

We would probably want to update the weights of neurons that didn't fire even if it's just by a little bit in case we got unlucky with our initial weights and want to give those neurons a chance of turning back on in the future."
