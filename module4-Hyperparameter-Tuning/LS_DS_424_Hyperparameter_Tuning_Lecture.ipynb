    "Hyperparameter tuning is much more important with neural networks than it has been with any other models that we have considered up to this point. Other supervised learning models might have a couple of parameters, but neural networks can have dozens. These can substantially affect the accuracy of our models and although it can be a time consuming process is a necessary step when working with neural networks.\n",
    "â€‹\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning comes with a challenge. How can we compare models specified with different hyperparameters if our model's final error metric can vary somewhat erratically? How do we avoid just getting unlucky and selecting the wrong hyperparameter? This is a problem that to a certain degree we just have to live with as we test and test again. However, we can minimize it somewhat by pairing our experiments with Cross Validation to reduce the variance of our final accuracy values."

    "### Hyperparameter Tuning Approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) Babysitting AKA \"Grad Student Descent\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If you fiddled with any hyperparameters yesterday, this is basically what you did. This approach is 100% manual and is pretty common among researchers where finding that 1 exact specification that jumps your model to a level of accuracy never seen before is the difference between publishing and not publishing a paper. Of course the professors don't do this themselves, that's grunt work. This is also known as the fiddle with hyperparameters until you run out of time method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Grid Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search is the Grad Student galaxy brain realization of: why don't I just specify all the experiments I want to run and let the computer try every possible combination of them while I go and grab lunch. This has a specific downside in that if I specify 5 hyperparameters with 5 options each then I've just created 5^5 combinations of hyperparameters to check. Which means that I have to train 3125 different versions of my model Then if I use 5-fold Cross Validation on that then my model has to run 15,525 times. This is the brute-force method of hyperparameter tuning, but it can be very profitable if done wisely. \n",
    "\n",
    "When using Grid Search here's what I suggest: don't use it to test combinations of different hyperparameters, only use it to test different specifications of **a single** hyperparameter. It's rare that combinations between different hyperparameters lead to big performance gains. You'll get 90-95% of the way there if you just Grid Search one parameter and take the best result, then retain that best result while you test another, and then retain the best specification from that while you train another. This at least makes the situation much more manageable and leads to pretty good results. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Random Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Do Grid Search for a couple of hours and you'll say to yourself - \"There's got to be a better way.\" Enter Random Search. For Random search you specify a hyperparameter space and it picks specifications from that randomly, tries them out, gives you the best results and says - That's going to have to be good enough, go home and spend time with your family. \n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search treats every parameter as if it was equally important, but this just isn't the case, some are known to move the needle a lot more than others (we'll talk about that in a minute). Random Search allows searching to be specified along the most important parameter and experiments less along the dimensions of less important hyperparameters. The downside of Random search is that it won't find the absolute best hyperparameters, but it is much less costly to perform than Grid Search. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4) Bayesian Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that can make more manual methods like babysitting and gridsearch effective is that as the experimenter sees results he can then make updates to his future searches taking into account the results of past specifications. If only we could hyperparameter tune our hyperparameter tuning. Well, we kind of can. Enter Bayesian Optimization. Neural Networks are like an optimization problem within an optimization problem, and Bayesian Optimization is a search strategy that tries to take into account the results of past searches in order to improve future ones. Check out the new library `keras-tuner` for easy implementations of Bayesian methods. \n"

    "## Batch Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch size determines how many observations the model is shown before it calculates loss/error and updates the model weights via gradient descent. You're looking for a sweet spot here where you're showing it enough observations that you have enough information to updates the weights, but not such a large batch size that you don't get a lot of weight update iterations performed in a given epoch. Feed-forward Neural Networks aren't as sensitive to bach_size as other networks, but it is still an important hyperparameter to tune. Smaller batch sizes will also take longer to train. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, batch size is set in powers of 2 starting at 32 up to 512. Keras defaults to a batch size of 32 if you do not specify it. Yann LeCun famously Twitted: \n",

I would start out tuning learning rates by orders of magnitude: [.001, .01, .1, .2, .3, .5] etc. I wouldn't go above .5, but you can try it and see what the behavior is like. \n",

Momentum is a property that decides the willingness of an optimizer to overshoot the minimum. Imagine a ball rolling down one side of a bowl and then up the opposite side a little bit before settling back to the bottom. The purpose of momentum is to try and escale local minima."

I don't understand all of them, but they can have a big affect on your model's initial accuracy. Your model will get further with less epochs if you initialize it with weights that are well suited to the problem you're trying to solve.\n",

    "\n",
    "the Dropout Regularization value is a percentage of neurons that you want to be randomly deactivated during training. The weight constraint is a second regularization parameter that works in tandem with dropout regularization. You should tune these two values at the same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using dropout on visible vs hidden layers might have a different effect. Using dropout on hidden layers might not have any effect while using dropout on hidden layers might have a substantial effect. You don't necessarily need to turn use dropout unless you see that your model has overfitting and generalizability problems."

    "\n",
    "Remember that when we only had a single perceptron our model was only able to fit to linearly separable data, but as we have added layers and nodes to those layers our network has become a powerhouse of fitting nonlinearity in data. The larger the network and the more nodes generally the stronger the network's capacity to fit nonlinear patterns in data. The more nodes and layers the longer it will take to train a network, and higher the probability of overfitting. The larger your network gets the more you'll need dropout regularization or other regularization techniques to keep it in check. \n",

    "Typically depth (more layers) is more important than width (more nodes) for neural networks. This is part of why Deep Learning is so highly touted. Certain deep learning architectures have truly been huge breakthroughs for certain machine learning tasks. \n",

    "You might borrow ideas from other network architectures. For example if I was doing image recognition and I wasn't taking cues from state of the art architectures like resnet, alexnet, googlenet, etc. Then I'm probably going to have to do a lot more experimentation on my own before I find something that works.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some heuristics, but I am highly skeptical of them. I think you're better off experimenting on your own and forming your own intuition for these kinds of problems. \n",
