        "K-fold Cross Validation is the best way to validate your model as it will reduce the variance of your overall accuracy measure by splitting the data into smaller cross validation batches using one of the split out datasets as the validation dataset. The model is then fit K times rotating the validation set until each portion of the data has served as the validation dataset, the accuracy results from each subset are then averaged and reported as the overall test accuracy. The upside is that you can be more confident in your model's final reported accuracy. The downside is that you have to train your model K times which is computationally expensive and just not pheasible for some large networks that can take days to train a single time.\n",

Other supervised learning models might have a couple of parameters, but neural networks can have dozens. These can substantially affect the accuracy of our models and although it can be a time consuming process is a necessary step when working with neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hyperparameter tuning comes with a challenge. How can we compare models specified with different hyperparameters if our model's final error metric can vary somewhat erratically? How do we avoid just getting unlucky and selecting the wrong hyperparameter? This is a problem that to a certain degree we just have to live with as we test and test again. However, we can minimize it somewhat by pairing our experiments with Cross Validation to reduce the variance of our final accuracy values."

        "\n",
        "### 1) Babysitting AKA \"Grad Student Descent\".\n",
        "\n",
        "If you fiddled with any hyperparameters yesterday, this is basically what you did. This approach is 100% manual and is pretty common among researchers where finding that 1 exact specification that jumps your model to a level of accuracy never seen before is the difference between publishing and not publishing a paper. Of course the professors don't do this themselves, that's grunt work. This is also known as the fiddle with hyperparameters until you run out of time method.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2) Grid Search\n",
        "\n",
        "Grid Search is the Grad Student galaxy brain realization of: why don't I just specify all the experiments I want to run and let the computer try every possible combination of them while I go and grab lunch. This has a specific downside in that if I specify 5 hyperparameters with 5 options each then I've just created 5^5 combinations of hyperparameters to check. Which means that I have to train 3125 different versions of my model Then if I use 5-fold Cross Validation on that then my model has to run 15,525 times. This is the brute-force method of hyperparameter tuning, but it can be very profitable if done wisely. \n",
        "\n",
        "When using Grid Search here's what I suggest: don't use it to test combinations of different hyperparameters, only use it to test different specifications of **a single** hyperparameter. It's rare that combinations between different hyperparameters lead to big performance gains. You'll get 90-95% of the way there if you just Grid Search one parameter and take the best result, then retain that best result while you test another, and then retain the best specification from that while you train another. This at least makes the situation much more manageable and leads to pretty good results. \n",
        "\n",
        "### 3) Random Search\n",
        "\n",
        "Do Grid Search for a couple of hours and you'll say to yourself - \"There's got to be a better way.\" Enter Random Search. For Random search you specify a hyperparameter space and it picks specifications from that randomly, tries them out, gives you the best results and says - That's going to have to be good enough, go home and spend time with your family. \n",
        "\n",
        "Grid Search treats every parameter as if it was equally important, but this just isn't the case, some are known to move the needle a lot more than others (we'll talk about that in a minute). Random Search allows searching to be specified along the most important parameter and experiments less along the dimensions of less important hyperparameters. The downside of Random search is that it won't find the absolute best hyperparameters, but it is much less costly to perform than Grid Search. \n",
        "\n",
        "### 4) Bayesian Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "One thing that can make more manual methods like babysitting and gridsearch effective is that as the experimenter sees results he can then make updates to his future searches taking into account the results of past specifications. If only we could hyperparameter tune our hyperparameter tuning. Well, we kind of can. Enter Bayesian Optimization. Neural Networks are like an optimization problem within an optimization problem, and Bayesian Optimization is a search strategy that tries to take into account the results of past searches in order to improve future ones. This is the most advanced method but can be a little bit tricky to implement. "

A learning rate that is too high will cause divergent behavior, but a Learning Rate that is too low will fail to converge, again, you're looking for the sweet spot. I would start out tuning learning rates by orders of magnitude: [.001, .01, .1, .2, .3, .5] etc. I wouldn't go above .5, but you can try it and see what the behavior is like. \n",

SGD is a common optimizer because it's what people understand and know, but I doubt it will get you the best results, you can try hyperparameter tuning its attributes and see if you can beat the performance from adam. Momentum is a property that decides the willingness of an optimizer to overshoot the minimum. Imagine a ball rolling down one side of a bowl and then up the opposite side a little bit before settling back to the bottom. The purpose of momentum is to try and escale local minima."

The larger the network and the more nodes generally the stronger the network's capacity to fit nonlinear patterns in data. The more nodes and layers the longer it will take to train a network, and higher the probability of overfitting. The larger your network gets the more you'll need dropout regularization or other regularization techniques to keep it in check. \n",

        "1) Use **at least** 3-fold cross validation. 5-fold or 10-fold would be better if you're patient enough.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Sampling your dataset can speed up iterations if you have enough data to justify it.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Start with \"Coarse Grids\" we gave an example of this when we were talking about Learning Rate, start with wide gaps between values that you're testing and then run additional tests with more narrow gaps between values until you find an optimum.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Even though we're using Cross Validation, reproducibility can still be a challenge. Don't be afraid to run some tests multiple times to see if you get the same results. Sometimes the accuracy differences are so slight that grid search picking one hyperparameter over another is just luck of the draw.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) Run your tests in verbose mode. Not only will you be less stressed out wondering if it's actually running, but you will be able to more quickly identify if something has gone haywire by glancing at the output every now and again.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) Pick a moderate amount of epochs and stick with that all throughout your training, until the very end, then tune your epochs. \n",
        "\n",
        "7) As you begin to have a lot of hyperparameters narrowed down, test them along with narrow versions of other hyperparameters in order to catch the small effects of interactions between specific hyperparameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "8) Being a perfectionist here is going to be a long and painful journey, so please do a cost-benefit analysis of how you're using your time here. Learn the concept, have the experience, but don't spend 3 days hyperparameter tuning your assignment."
